# Swift Protobuf Runtime Library

**Welcome to Swift Protobuf!**

Apple's Swift programming language is a perfect complement to Google's Protocol
Buffer serialization technology.  They both emphasize high performance
and programmer safety.

This project provides the runtime library that is necessary for using
code generated by the protoc Swift plugin.  After using the protoc
plugin to generate Swift code from your .proto files, you will need to
add this library to your project.

For more information about Swift Protobuf, please look at:
* [Swift Protobuf code generator plugin](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf-plugin)
* [Swift Protobuf Conformance Checker](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf-test-conformance)

## Using the library with `swift build`

If you are using the Swift Package Manager, this only requires adding one dependency to your Package.swift file:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .Package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf-runtime.git",
           Version(0,9,12))
]
```

To make sure you are using the correct library version here, run
protoc-gen-swift with the --version option:

```
$ protoc-gen-swift --version
protoc-gen-swift 0.9.12
```

You should use the version of the swift-protobuf-runtime library that
matches your protoc-gen-swift plugin.

## Using the library with Xcode

If you are using Xcode, then you should:
* Add the Swift source files generated from your protos directly to your project
* Add the Protobuf target from the Xcode project in this package to your project.

## Using the library with CocoaPods

If you're using CocoaPods, add this to your `Podfile`:

~~~ruby
pod 'SwiftProtobufRuntime', git: 'https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf-runtime.git'
~~~

And run `pod install`.

(Swift 3 frameworks require CocoaPods 1.1 or newer)

## Report any issues

If you run into problems, please send us a detailed report.  At a minimum, please include:
* The specific operating system and version (for example, "macOS 10.12.1" or "Ubuntu 15.10")
* The version of Swift you have installed (from `swift --version`)
* The version of the protoc compiler you are working with from `protoc --version`
* The specific version of this source code (you can use `git log -1` to get the latest commit ID)
* Any local changes you may have
